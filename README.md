# mana_ec_webpage
This is going to be a webpage project to build a site for Mana E-C engineering and construction

The project is for my dad's construction company. He already has one for their main company, JT2 Engineering and 
Construction, but he does not yet have one built for their second company, Mana E-C.
I am going to be doing this as a project to work on real-world solutions, and if he likes it, he told me they
would buy it from me, essentially making this my first professional gig.
He already has a url for it, www.manna-ec.com, but it just has the 'Launching Soon' holding page. This means I'll
be able to just work on the code and they can drop it in the source.
